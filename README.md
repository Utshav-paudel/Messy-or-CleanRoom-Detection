# Messy-or-CleanRoom-Detection
In this project I will finetune pretrained VGG16 model using transfer learning to detect clean or messy room

## Reasons for using Transfer Learning in this project :
Due to the limitation of training data transfer learning was best option for this project.
* Only had 190 images for training
* Only had 20 images for validation
* Only had 10 images for test
